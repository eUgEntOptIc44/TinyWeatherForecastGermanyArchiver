tl;dr -> submit web sites ([`urls.txt`](https://github.com/tinyweatherforecastgermanygroup/TinyWeatherForecastGermanyArchiver/blob/53190e46e470222ef3a51c562165ef93ebe3d4b4/urls.txt)) of  [**TinyWeatherForecastGermany**](https://codeberg.org/Starfish/TinyWeatherForecastGermany) (TWFG) to the web archive

[Tiny Weather Forecast Germany](https://tinyweatherforecastgermanygroup.gitlab.io/index/) is an android open source weather app focused on Germany developped by Pawel Dube ([@Starfish](https://codeberg.org/Starfish)) using [open data](https://opendata.dwd.de/) provided by Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD).

The DWD is Germany's **national weather agency** (similiar to **N**ational **O**ceanic **a**nd **A**tmospheric **A**dministration ([NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/about-our-agency)) in the US).

**Note**:
* *'TWFG'* is an unofficial abbreviation for ***T**iny **W**eather **F**orecast **G**ermany.*
* *[ExodusPrivacy](https://github.com/Exodus-Privacy)* also partially uses the alternative spelling *'Îµxodus'*. To maintain readability the author sticks to the first version without the leading greek character.

## Dependencies
